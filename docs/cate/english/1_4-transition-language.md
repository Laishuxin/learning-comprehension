## Chinese language

Chinese language is used as a mother tongue by the largest number of people across the world. A prominent difference between Chinese language and western language lies in that the former is comprised of characters rather than letters. Chinese language is the oldest of all writing systems which are still in use at the moment. In China, people from different areas may not understand each other's dialects. However, thanks to the unified written form of Chinese characters, they hardly have any difficulty in communicating. Historically speaking, Chinese language played an important part in unification of the Chinese nation. Nowadays, with the rapid economic growth and increasing global influence of China, more and more foreigners have started to learn Chinese.
