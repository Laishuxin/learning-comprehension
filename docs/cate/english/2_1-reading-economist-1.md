## English-medium education

Babel is better.

### Young children should be taught in their mother tongue, not in English.

When Winston Churchill was at Harrow School, he was in the lower stream. This did not, he wrote in _"My Early Life"_, blight his academic career, for "I gained an immense advantage over the clearer boys. They were all went on to learn Latin and Greek and splendid things like that. We were all considered such dunces that we could learn only English... Thus I got into my bones the essential structure of the ordinary British sentence -- which is a noble thing.

Partly thanks to Churchill and the post-war Anglo-American ascendancy, English is these days prized, not despised. Over a billion people speak it as either their first or second language; more still as a third or fourth language. English perfectly exemplifies the "network effect": the more people use it, the more useful is it. English is the language of international business, law, science, medicine, entertainment and--since the second world war, to the fury of the French--diplomacy.

Anybody who wants to make their way in the world must speak it. All of which, of course, be of great benefit to this newspaper, which has floated on a rising linguistic tide.
