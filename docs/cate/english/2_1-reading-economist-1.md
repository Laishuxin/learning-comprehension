## English-medium education

Babel is better.

### Young children should be taught in their mother tongue, not in English.

When Winston Churchill was at Harrow School, he was in the lower stream. This did not, he wrote in _"My Early Life"_, blight his academic career, for "I gained an immense advantage over the clearer boys. They were all went on to learn Latin and Greek and splendid things like that. We were all considered such dunces that we could learn only English... Thus I got into my bones the essential structure of the ordinary British sentence -- which is a noble thing.

Partly thanks to Churchill and the post-war Anglo-American ascendancy, English is these days prized, not despised. Over a billion people speak it as either their first or second language; more still as a third or fourth language. English perfectly exemplifies the "network effect": the more people use it, the more useful is it. English is the language of international business, law, science, medicine, entertainment and--since the second world war, to the fury of the French--diplomacy.

Anybody who wants to make their way in the world must speak it. All of which has, of course, been of great benefit to this newspaper, which has floated on a rising linguistic tide.

It is not surprising that there is **surge** in English-medium education all over the world.

In some regions -- such as East Asia and Latin American, the growth is principally among the rich. In others--Africa and South Asia, where former colonies never quite escaped the language's grip--it is happening at all income levels.

Parents' desire for their children to master English is spurring the the growth of private schooling; parents in the **slums** of Delhi and Lagos buy English-medium education **in the hope that** their children would gain a university degree, obtain good jobs and even join a glittering world of global professionals.

Where private sector leads, governments are following.

Some countries have long chosen to teach in English as a political expedient, because a local language would prove contentious.

But even where public schools teach children in their mother tongue, education authorities are switching to English medium, in part ot stem the outflow into the private sector.

That has happened in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan; many Indian states have started large or small English-medium experiments.

In Africa most children are supported to be taught in a local language in the first few years, but often, **through** parental pressure or a lack of textbooks, it does not happen.
