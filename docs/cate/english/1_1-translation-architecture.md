### Beijing Daxing International Airport

Beijing Daxing International Airport, located 46 kilometers south of Tian' anmen Square, was put into operation on September 30, 2019. The giant project started its construction in 2014, with more than 40, 000 workers on the site at its peak. The terminal building is compact in design, allowing the largest number of aircraft to park directly at the location closest to the center of the terminal building, which provides great convenience to passengers. There are a total of 82 boarding gates in the terminal building, but passengers can get any gate in less than 8 minutes after passing the security check. The airport is designed to ensure 300 times of landing and take-off per hour. The annual passenger volume of the airport will reach 100 million in 2040, which is expected to be the busiest airport in the world.

### Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge

With a total length of 55 kilometers, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is an unusual engineering feat of our country. As the longest sea-crossing bridge and tunnel system in the world, it connects three cities and shortens the travel time among them from 3 hours to 30 minutes. The reinforced concrete bridge with tremendous span is a testament to China's ability to build record-breaking and gigantic architectures. It will boost regional integration and stimulate economic growth. The bridge is a key to developing China's master plan of the Greater Bay Area. China hopes that this area can rival San Francisco, New York and Tokyo in technological innovation and economic prosperity.

### Qinghai-Tibet Railway

Qinghai-Tibet Railway is the highest and longest plateau railway in the world with a total length of 1, 956 kilometers, of which 960 kilometers are at an altitude of more than 4, 000 meters. It is also the first railway connecting Tibet and other parts of China. As the railway traverses the most vulnerable ecosystem in the world, ecological protection measures have been taken during and after the construction to ensure that it becomes a "green railroad". Qinghai-Tibet Railway has greatly shortened the travel time to Tibet. More importantly, it has significantly promoted the economic development of Tibet and improved the living standards of residents. After the opening of the railway, more and more people choose to travel to Tibet by train, so that they will have the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the line.
