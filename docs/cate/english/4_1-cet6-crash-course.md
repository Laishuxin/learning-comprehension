## 听力

<!-- ### 视听一致原则

视听一致：信息越一致，越可能是正确的答案。（**比较使用于简单题**）

1. 关键信息于音频完全一致。
2. 关键信息在音频中出现的次数越多。如果出现的次数一样多时，
   则需要选择符合问题的选项。 -->

### 关键词原则

### 同转原则

### 正确及错误答案的特点

## 翻译

翻译的关键：

1. 不错。句子没有明显的语法和词汇错误。
2. 语序正确。注意中文和英文之间的语序差异。

### 修饰后置

使用条件：

1. 定语较长。
2. 元素复杂。

常见的句式：

1. 状语。

   - 时间
   - 地点

2. 定语。
   - xxx 的

#### 介词的使用

原则：

1. 使用了介词 > 错误使用介词 > 无使用介词。
2. 是否使用介词还取决于能否用形容词直接表示。如果可以用
   形容词直接表示，那么就不需要介词。

例如： 他们渴望拥有一套属于自己的体面舒适的栖身之所。

1. They are eager to own a decent and comfortable place
   of their own.
2. They are eager to own their decent and comfortable place.

这里 **体面舒适的** 就可以直接使用形容词进行修饰。

**属于自己的** 也可以直接修饰，如第 2 句所示，但是这样会导致
头重脚轻，所以最好的方式是将修饰词进行后置，如第 1 句所示。

常用的介词有：of, in, for, ...

Ex1: 过中秋节的习俗于唐代早期在中国各地开始流行。
The tradition of celebrating Mid-Autumn festival became popular throughout China in the early Tang dynasty.

Ex2: 教育部还决定改善欠发达地区学生的营养，
并为外来务工人员的子女提供在城市接受教育的同等机会。

The Ministry of Education has decided to improve the
nutrition of students in underdeveloped regions and to
provide equal opportunities for children of immigrant
workers to receive education in urban areas.

#### 定语从句

定语从句的分类：

- 限制性定语从句：that, who, when, where, ...
- 非限制性定语从句：which. （中文句式：这，该，其，此）

Ex1: 对于那些月薪较低却渴望在大城市拥有一套属于自己的
体面舒适的栖身之所的人来说，高昂的房价是他们无法承受的负担。

For those who earn less but are eager to own a decent and
comfortable place of their own in a big city, the high
housing price is a heavy burden that they cannot afford.

Ex2: 如果这一目标得以实现，今后大部分进入劳动力市场的人
都需要获得大学文凭。

If the goal is achieved, most of those who want to enter
the labor market will have to acquire a college degree in
the future.

Ex3: 大学生之间的竞争越来越激烈，这导致任何一名大学生找到工作
的机会都变小了。

Competition among graduates has become more and more fierce,
which results in a decreasing chance for any individual
graduate to find a job.

![](./images/2021-05-31-21-56-07.png)

#### 插入语

使用条件：

1. 该句为翻译开头句。
2. 名词解释。

Ex1: 旅游业是最近二十年来在世界各地迅速发展的一个行业，这引起
中国公总越来越多的注意。

1. Tourism is a fast-growing industry over the last decades
   all over the world, which is now receiving more and more
   attention from the Chinese public.

2. Tourism, a fast-growing industry over the last two
   decades all over the world, is now receiving more
   and more attention from the Chinese public.

![](./images/2021-05-31-21-56-25.png)

### 多动词

#### 动词与动词地位相同

使用并列结构：

$v_1$, $v_2$ and $v_3$

Ex1: 政府已经设定目标减少污染，提高能源使用效率，改善得到教育
和医保的机会，并扩大社会保障。

The government has set goals to reduce pollution, enhance
energy efficiency, improve the educational opportunities
and medical insurance and expand social security.

![](./images/2021-05-31-21-56-39.png)

#### 动词之间地位不同

1. 找到主动词（也就是句子中的谓语）
2. 其他动词使用其对应的格式。
   - to do: 表示目的。如：来，以达到，为了。
   - doing: 主动。
   - done: 被动。

Ex1: 鉴于这一状况，政府今年来采取了一系列措施来防止房价快增长，
包括提高利率及增加居税等。

For this situation, the government has taken a series of
measures to prevent the housing price from growing too
fast, including raising interest rates and increasing
taxes on real estate, and so on.

![](./images/2021-05-31-21-56-50.png)

Ex2: 第三份报告呼吁加强顶层设计，以消除工业升级中的结构障碍并
促进节能减排。

The third one suggests enhancing top-level designs to
get rid of the structural obstacles in industrial
upgrading and promotes energy conservation and emission
reduction.

![](./images/2021-05-31-21-57-03.png)

Ex3: 市政府还计划建造一批水循环利用工厂，并制止违章建筑，用以
改善环境。

The municipal government also plants to construct some
plants to use cycle water, banning illegal constructions
to modify environment.

### 无主语

#### 补充主语（不推荐）

#### 转被动

Ex1: 必须保持每天 8 个小时睡眠。

（缺失主语，直接使用被动）

Eight hours' sleep must be guaranteed every day.

Ex2: 因此，强烈建议大学生在课余时间做一些兼职工作，以积累相关
的工作经验。

（由于这里没有提及谁建议的，采用被动语态较为合适）

Therefore, college students are strongly suggested to do
some part-time jobs in their spare time to accumulate
relevant working experience.

#### 非人主语 - 有/存在

there be / exist

Ex1: 宴席上通常至少有一道汤，可以最先或最后上桌。

There usually is at least one soap in the feast, which can
be served at the beginning or at last.
