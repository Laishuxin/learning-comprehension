## 不定时 / 非谓语

常见形式：

- to do
- do

特点：不受限制。即，没有人称、单复数以及情态的变化限制。
什么叫不受限制？考虑下面的例子：
- He wants to go.
- He wanted to go.
- They want to go.

从上面的例子我们了解到，want 作为动词需要根据上下文进行改变，而 **to go** 作为不定式，不会因为上下文改变而改变。

### 作用

1. 使役动词（make, let, have, bid）后，对宾语做补充说明。
   - That joke make me **laugh**.
   - I let him **leave**.
   - I have him **look at** my car.
   - She **bide** me to approach her. (bid - bade - bid)
   <br>
   **NOTE**: 使役动词转为被动时，to 不能省略。(ex: I was made to laugh by that joke.)
   
2. 与感官动词（feel, hear, saw, etc.）连用，表达动作的瞬时性。
   - I saw him **go into** a bank when I was driving home.
   - I hurried after the thief up the stairs into the study and saw him **push** the window open and **jump** off.
   - He saw two thieves **rush out of** a shop and run towards a waiting car.
   <br/>
   **NOTE**: 感官动词 + do 与感官动词 + doing 表达效果是不一样的。感官动词 + doing 强调的是动作的持续性（ongoing state）。
3. 充当宾语或宾语补足语。
   - She intended **to dress** up as a ghost.
   - Not waiting **to frighten** the poor man.
4. 作为主语。
   - **To err** is human. (人非圣贤，孰能无过。)
   - **To know** me is to love me.
   - It is nice **to see you**.
5. 充当表语。
   - What you should do is **make a list**.
   - What I did was **call him and apologize**.
6. 作为后置定语。
   - the man **to save** us.
